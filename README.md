# categorize_triangles

This project categorizes triangles based on the dimensions.

It will categorize the triangles as: 'No triangle', 'Equillateral', 'Isosceles', 'Right', 'Acute,' or 'Obtuse'.

Personally, I found the mathematical equations that determined each triangle type. Then I used "Obtuse" if none of the others matched.

The reason is I couldn't find an equation for an obtuse triangle.

Also, the program automatically takes the longest side and determines that it is the hypotenuse.
That way, you can enter the sides in any order and it will output correctly.
